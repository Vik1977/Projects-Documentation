## CCTV cam√©ra i found in the trash:

 no label, no sign, no manufacturer, google search by image shows a similar camera on a website called Madeinchina (so reassuring), has one RJ45 jack and a power connector (12 volt?)


Tested and made one of them function,  
When connected to power and ethernet the led on the RJ45 jack starts blinking (good sign),  
 on the router doesnt appear anything, dont think it has DHCP
